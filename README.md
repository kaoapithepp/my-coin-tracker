# mycointracker.app
Personal cryptocurrency price tracker

## Background of this side project
This project is happened due to my personal interest. Because I'm currently trading on Shiba Inu, Ethereum and BNB so I created this site for keeping eyes on their prices and find out that I'm lossing or gaining.

## Releasing Note
### V.1.1
There are a lot of hard coding inside the source code. Next plan is improving the code by using useReducer and managing the mess of API calling. Moreover, I will add the core value of this site about how much we spent and does it loss or gain.

Appreciate and Please with CoinGecko API.
